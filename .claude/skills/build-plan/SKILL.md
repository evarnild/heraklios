# /build-plan — draft and validate an intent's plan

Follow `intents/README.md` → "Drafting an artefact" for everything the three
drafting skills share. This file adds only what is the plan's own. It is not
Claude Code's plan mode, and it writes `plan.md` in the intent's folder, not
the root `plan.md`.

Stamp: `<!-- generated-by: heraklios/build-plan@0.1.0 -->` as the first line
of `plan.md`.

## 1. Check the preconditions, and stop if one fails

Read `intents/<id>-*/metadata.yml`. Stop and say which is missing if:

- `type` is adjustment or experiment (neither has a plan);
- the gate before the plan is not recorded: `spec_accepted` for a feature,
  `intent_accepted` for a fix or refactor.

## 2. Read first

- the intent, and the spec for a feature;
- `intents/_templates/plan.md`;
- `REVIEW-POLICY.md`: tiers, live checks, the review passes;
- every file, symbol and line the plan will rely on, on current `main`.

## 3. No question round

A question at plan time means the spec (or, for a fix or refactor, the
intent) is incomplete. Report it and stop; do not decide a design point
here.

## 4. Write `plan.md` from the template

- Goal;
- Risks: this repo's known bug classes (drift-machine fall-through, tests
  that pass whatever the code does, stale line citations, the lint cap) plus
  anything specific;
- **Verified against the codebase**: "Re-read on `main` at `<hash>`", then
  `path:line — what is there` for each reliance;
- Subtasks, each committable with `npm run verify` green;
- Tests: for each behavioural line, the test that would fail if it were
  mutated; for a fix, the failing-first test;
- Validation: `npm run verify`, `npm run check:intent`, `npm run e2e` when
  the paths call for it, and the live-check steps when one is owed by path;
- Assumptions I made;
- the `## Progress` marker, left empty.

## 5. Validate

- every spec B and AC (feature), or intent outcome (fix, refactor), maps to
  a subtask and a test or check;
- every `path:line` was read at the recorded commit;
- no subtask needs a gate that is not recorded.

## 6. Report

Name the folder, the weak points, and the next step: "approve by setting
`plan_approved: <date>` in metadata.yml, or say yes".
