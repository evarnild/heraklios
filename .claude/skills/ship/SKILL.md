# /ship — merge a reviewed intent and clean up

You are the **coordinator** (the main checkout, on `main`). This skill wraps
`npm run ship`, which does the steps as tested code. The rules it applies are
`REVIEW-POLICY.md` → "Merging" (preconditions, `--no-ff`, `verify`,
bookkeeping); read that section rather than relying on this file. The design
is `intents/46-ship-skill/spec.md`.

## The request

`/ship <id>` is the owner's explicit request, for intent §id only and in this
conversation, to record the live check (below), merge, push, and remove the
worktree and branch. Run nothing without that request, and never for an id
the owner didn't name. If no id was given, ask for it; don't guess one from
`plan.md` or the sessions list. A request for one id doesn't carry over to
another.

## Run it

1. **The live check.** Add `--live-checked "<the owner's words>"` only when
   the owner's message invoking `/ship` says they ran the live check (for
   example "live checked, /ship 44"), quoting their words as they wrote them.
   Never add it from your own reading of the state, from `review.md`, or from
   your own browser run. Without it, a live check that is owed and not
   recorded stops the run, which is the right outcome.
2. **Attribution.** Pass each attribution line your session was given for
   commits as `--trailer "<line>"` (repeat the flag). The script adds none of
   its own.
3. **Run:** `npm run ship -- <id> [--live-checked "…"] [--trailer "…"]…`
4. **`/ship <id> --dry-run`, or "can §N ship?"** or any question about
   readiness: run `npm run ship -- <id> --dry-run` instead. It changes
   nothing (it does not even fetch) and prints every step as done, to do, or
   the first thing that would stop it.
5. **Where:** the script runs only from the main checkout, on `main`. From
   a worktree it stops at `start` with "run from the main checkout"; relay
   that, don't work around it.

## Relay the report

Give the owner the script's report as it is: one line per step (commit
hashes, the push range, removed paths), or the step it stopped at and why.
Then:

- **Stopped:** say which step and what the script advises. Don't work around
  it: no `--force`, no reset, no `branch -D`, no hand-editing to get past a
  check, and don't commit another session's uncommitted `plan.md` as your
  own. A red `verify` after the merge is reported, not undone; whether to
  revert is the owner's call.
- **"Left for you":** the worktree folder is held open by a session or an
  editor. Tell the owner to close it, then run
  `npm run ship -- <id> --cleanup`. Don't stop processes.
- **Re-running** `/ship <id>` after fixing what stopped a run resumes where
  it stopped; only on the owner's request.
- **Complete:** say so. Updating `heraklios-stable` is a separate request.
